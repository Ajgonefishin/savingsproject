		<p>Savings and MMDAs are easy ways to get interest on money. Some savings accounts are connected to checking accounts for easy access. When you put money into a savings account, you can earn interest on it, though not as much as a CD. However, you can get access to this money very frequently, and put money in/out. MMDAs are similar, but they may have higher APY and less access. </p>
		<h1>Real Rates</h1>
		<p>Here are some real Savings and MMDA rates from Ally Bank. The Ally Bank Online Savings Account has a 2.2% APY. There aren't any fees and you get to do 6 transactions. The Ally Bank Money Market Account's APY depends on daily balance, with 0.9% APY if you have $5,000 or less in your account, and 1% APY if you have $25,000 in your account. There are unlimited deposits and ATM withdrawals with it.</p>
		<h1>Why These Could Be Beneficial For You</h1>
		<p>If you are just starting out in savings and interest, these might be the best option for you. A Savings account is easy to open and a good way to get started as they have decent APY and let you get money in and out. MMDAs are also a good starting point as there are more ways to get money in and out.</p>
