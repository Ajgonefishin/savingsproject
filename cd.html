		<p>Certificates of Deposit, or CDs, are one of the best ways to earn <a href="interest.html">interest</a> on your money. When you open a CD with a bank, you give them some amount of money that will then gain interest over time. Usually, banks will have a minimum amount you have to give. They will keep your money for a period that you decide, which can range from 1 year to over 5 years. The interest rate increases the more time you keep your money in the bank.</p>
		<h1>Real Rates</h1>
		<p>You can find good examples of real CD rates from <a href="https://www.ally.com/bank/high-yield-cd/">Ally Bank</a>. At Ally Bank, a 6-month CD will provide 1% APY, a 12-month CD will provide 2.75% APY, and a 5-year CD will have 3.1% APY. Many other banks will most likely have similar rates, so this is what you can expect. </p>
		<h1>CD Ladders</h1>
		<p>CD ladders are one of the most effective ways to use CDs. They are how you can get the highest APY and also have access to your money most frequently. You first decide how big you want it to be, example would be a 4-year rate. Then, you need to open a CD for each year, so a 1-year CD, a 2-year CD, a 3-year CD, and a 4-year CD. As each CD matures, replace it with a 4-year CD. After 4 years, you would have a CD maturing each year at a 4-year APY. You can do this with any APY, and as frequently as you want/need.</p>
